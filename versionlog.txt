Note :
1. Please DO NOT run `yarn` on this repo, the required node_modules folder can be received from Skype: live:haseeb293. In future this will be provided on shared drive.

Prescribed process :
1.	Release should always be deployed from 
	a.	main repository  e.g. >> dev-2.1.rc
2.	All changes customization by individuals should be done in their separate respective branch
	a.	Like >>dev-2.1.rc/<Your branch name>
3.	No stable code in main repository no release deployed, Code in main repository should be stable
4.	No pull request no code pushes to main repository
5.	Two files would  be added in root. Sample files are attached
	a.	version.txt
	b.	versionlog.txt
6.	No change in above two files would cause pull request rejection right away.
	a.	The ideology behind above files is to capture the code context/completeness that is being added/changed.

Improvements/Suggestions : 
1.	Always create your local branch before starting any change/development and maintain code there until done/complete.
2.	Do not push your code to main or any shared branch until it builds with 0 bugs and is stable.


Following are the code versioning guidelines

1.	Version format = Major.Minor.Patch.Build e.g. 2.1.5.3
�	Major : Major release, Architecture level changes, New modules added, Major product enhancement or changes, Marketing strategy, RetailSDK Major version changes.
�	Minor : Minor feature is introduced, Set of smaller features were rolled out, a smaller module is added. Several mid to high level bugs fixed
�	Patch : Bug fixes, patches, performance enhancements, It might represent a change set transition in TV Context
